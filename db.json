Birria: goat meat stewed in a broth of chili peppers and spices .  \n12 . Flan: custard made from eggs, milk, sugar, vanilla extract\n\n#  What do they include?\n\nThere are a variety of different types of homeowners insurance policies, and each one includes its own specific set of protections. However, most policies generally include the same basic coverages, such as damage to the home caused by fire, wind, or hail; theft or burglary; and personal liability.\n\nIn addition, many policies also offer optional coverages that can provide additional protection for the home and its contents. Some of these optional coverages include water damage, earthquake damage, and dog bite coverage.\n\n# What is the cost?\n\nThe cost of homeowners insurance depends on a number of factors, including the type of policy, the amount of coverage purchased, and the location of the home. However, on average, homeowners insurance costs between $600 and $1,200 per year.\n\n# How do I get it?\n\nHomeowners insurance can be purchased from a variety of different sources, including insurance companies, brokers, and agents. To find the best policy for your needs and budget, it is important to compare the different options available to you.\n\n#  How did you discover them?\n\nThere are many ways to discover new music. You can hear it on the radio, see it promoted on TV, or find it recommended by friends or family. But there's also a wealth of great music out there that you can find online, if you know where to look.\n\nOne great way to find new music is through streaming services like Spotify and Apple Music. These services allow you to listen to millions of songs for free, or for a monthly subscription fee. They also have built-in algorithms that recommend new music based on your listening habits.\n\nAnother great way to find new music is through online forums and communities like Reddit and Bandcamp. These platforms allow users to share their favourite music with others, and often have sections dedicated to specific genres or styles of music.\n\nFinally, one of the best ways to find new music is by exploring independent artists and labels. There's a lot of great music out there that isn't played on the radio or TV, so it pays to do some digging online. Websites like Soundcloud and Bandcamp are great places to start, but don't be afraid to explore smaller websites and forums too.\n\n#  What are your thoughts on them?\n\n#\n\nCreating an estate plan is one of the most important things you can do for yourself and your loved ones. But what are your thoughts on them? Do you think they're important? Here are some reasons why you should think estate planning is important:\n\n1. An estate plan can help ensure your loved ones are taken care of after you're gone.\n\n2. An estate plan can help avoid probate and ensure your assets are distributed according to your wishes.\n\n3. An estate plan can help protect your loved ones from costly legal battles and disputes.\n\n4. An estate plan can provide peace of mind knowing that your affairs are in order.\n\n#  Are there any others that you would like to see added to the list?\n\nThe list of top 5 programming languages is always changing.\n\nThere are new languages emerging all the time and others that are falling out of popularity.\n\nSo, it can be tricky to keep track of which languages are the most popular and important right now.\n\nBut don’t worry, we’ve got you covered!\n\nBelow is a list of the 5 most popular programming languages as of 2019.\n\n\n\n\n 1. Java \nJava is one of the most popular programming languages in the world and has been around for a long time. It’s often used for back-end development and is known for its stability and efficiency. Java is also a platform-independent language, meaning that it can be used for developing applications on various platforms including Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux.\n\n\n\n\n2. Python \npython is an interpreted high-level general-purpose programming language which focuses on code readability. It’s often used in data science and machine learning projects, but it can be used for a variety of purposes. Python also has a large community that creates libraries and modules to enhance its functionality.\n\n\n\n \n3. C++ \nC++ is a powerful object-oriented programming language that enables developers to create sophisticated software systems. It’s often used in game development, simulation, and graphics rendering projects. Additionally, C++ has cross-platform compatibility, meaning that it can be used to develop software for different types of devices and operating systems. \n\n\n\n 4. JavaScript \nJavaScript is one of the most popular front-end development languages and is used to create interactive user interfaces and web applications. It’s also one of the few languages that can run on both browsers and servers. And because JavaScript has such a large community, there are tons of resources available to help developers learn and use it effectively.\n\n","source":"_posts/What-are-the-12-Latin-American-delicacies.md","raw":"---\ntitle: What are the 12 Latin American delicacies\ndate: 2022-08-18 19:43:54\ncategories:\n- Chicuterie\ntags:\n---\n\n\n#  What are the 12 Latin American delicacies?\n\n1.
