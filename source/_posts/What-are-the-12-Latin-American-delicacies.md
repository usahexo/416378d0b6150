#  How did you discover them?

There are many ways to discover new music. You can hear it on the radio, see it promoted on TV, or find it recommended by friends or family. But there's also a wealth of great music out there that you can find online, if you know where to look.

One great way to find new music is through streaming services like Spotify and Apple Music. These services allow you to listen to millions of songs for free, or for a monthly subscription fee. They also have built-in algorithms that recommend new music based on your listening habits.

Another great way to find new music is through online forums and communities like Reddit and Bandcamp. These platforms allow users to share their favourite music with others, and often have sections dedicated to specific genres or styles of music.

Finally, one of the best ways to find new music is by exploring independent artists and labels. There's a lot of great music out there that isn't played on the radio or TV, so it pays to do some digging online. Websites like Soundcloud and Bandcamp are great places to start, but don't be afraid to explore smaller websites and forums too.
